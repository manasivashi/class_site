Where the ladies smoke cigars,
Every puff they take
Is enough to kill a snake.

They put diamonds in their heads.

It is 1968."
They're hermetic secrets in the oral tradition, and when recited under the proper circumstances (generally involving pulverized seeds bearing lysergic acid amide) they amount to a form of Time Travel for Pedestrians.
A cryptic exposition on this method was published under a weak pseudonym (as a logical derivation from semi-secret radiant field theory) by Michael Faraday, in 1972.</div>

      <div class="title">From Feb. 13 to 15, the Romans celebrated the feast of Lupercalia. The men sacrificed a goat and a dog, then whipped women with the hides of the animals they had just slain.

The Roman romantics "were drunk. They were naked," says Noel Lenski, a historian at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Young women would actually line up for the men to hit them, Lenski says. They believed this would make them fertile.

The brutal fete included a matchmaking lottery, in which young men drew the names of women from a jar. The couple would then be, um, coupled up for the duration of the festival — or longer, if the match was right.
As the years went on, the holiday grew sweeter. Chaucer and Shakespeare romanticized it in their work, and it gained popularity throughout Britain and the rest of Europe. Handmade paper cards became the tokens-du-jour in the Middle Ages.

Eventually, the tradition made its way to the New World. The industrial revolution ushered in factory-made cards in the 19th century. And in 1913, Hallmark Cards of Kansas City, Mo., began mass producing valentines. February has not been the same since.</div>
