  <div class="info"><a href="https://www.are.na/manasi-vashi/noise-1520545477">IMAGE JOURNAL<p>This is my image journal.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="script/index.html">SCRIPT<p>This is a script. It was meant to be produced as a composition via a set of instructions. Yoko Ono's 'Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings' was a great inpiration for me. I enjoyed the vagueness of her pieces because it allowed me to imagine whatever I wanted from it, and so I wanted to use the idea of vaguness in the script. Our set of instructions comprised of a series of 'do nots', which meant to make people aware of themselves and their actions before the final instruction. </p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="5html/index.html">HTML<p>These are 5 html pages. I decided to just begin coding the first thing that came to my head and wanted to use the simplest HTMl actions. </p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="pixel/index.html">PIXEL PORTRAIT<p>This is my pixel portrait. Attempting to make a self portrait definitely made me appreciate pixel artists a lot more.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="linking_tree/index.html"><h1>LINKING TREE<p>This is my linking tree. It was meant to focus on the relationship between trees and the web, the structure of how web pages link together and proliferate. The idea of one thing branching out into separate parts led me to think about duality and choosing between 'good' and 'evil'. I wanted to send people on a path (of their choosing) but lead them to the unknown. If someone were to go back and try a different path, they would notice that the 'good' and the 'evil' sides were identical, suggesting that things should not be categorized as good or evil.</p></a></h1>
  <div class="info"><a href="boxes/index.html">MALEVICH'S BOXES<p>These are my boxes.<br>‘In the year 1913, trying desperately to free art from the dead weight of the real world, I took refuge in the form of the square.’ — The Non-Objective World, 1927, Kazimir Malevich.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="mix/index.html">MIX<p>This is my mix. I wanted to explore the ways in which code can render imagery, motion, and audio all together. I used a song produced by my brother, Sid Vashi, for the audio, clips of the documentary Blue Planet II for the motion, and ocean inspired imagery with animations. 
</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="clock/index.html">CLOCK<p>This is my clock. I was continuing the theme of 'underwater' from the Mix project. The idea was to portray time as an oppotunity to start over. If I plan to begin doing a task, I tend to begin at the hour or half hour mark. I animated a fish to enter the screen each minute, until there are 59 fish, and at the hour mark a shark comes into the screen and clears out the fish to have it start over again.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="still_life/index.html">STILL LIFE<p>This is still life.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="disrupt_climate/index.html">DISRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE<p></p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="filter/index.html">SELECT<p>These are pictures of the human body, filtered as body parts. For most of my projects, I use old images from the NYPL collections. I wanted to make the background pink to contrast the goriness of the illustrations.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="april/index.html">FLEXBOX<p>This is a calender for April.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="container/index.html">CONTAINER<p>This is my universe. The Power of Ten film by Charles and Ray Eames was the main inspiration for me. I liked the idea of seeing things in the universe as within eachother. So I wanted my container to be the entire universe, and wanted to log all the celestial bodies in the univrse between the earth and the end of 'the observable universe' as we know it. In this case, the container is ever-expanding.
</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="responsive/index.html">RESPONSIVE<p>This is a comic strip. The idea having the visuals on a screen respond to its size made me things of a series of images to tell a story. So I thought showing a comic strip was the best way to tell a moving story with still images. </p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="note/index.html">MOBILE<p>This is my note pad. I thought about what I use most on both my phone and my laptop - notes. I wanted to create a more personalized version of a note keeper that I would like to write things on.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="word+image/index.html">WORD+IMAGE<p>These are words and images. I wanted to have large text written on a full size version of the most famous paintings of the world. The words chosen were all adjectives, making it seem like the combination of word and image was a commentary on the piece.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="self/index.html">SELF<p>This is myself. The inspiration for this piece was the website 'Everything I've Ever Wanted To Know'. I write a lot of randoms things down, that don't make entire sense if you would read it, but made me want to remember it at the time which means it impacted me in some way, and its a way of documenting my thought process through time.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="fantasy/index.html">HAND<p>This is my fantasy. It was meant to show the interaction of ours hands and smartphones and how we comprehend the world via our hand technologies. A part from Darian Leader's 'Hands: What We Do with Them and Why' spoke about addiction to cigarettes. "The overflowing agitation of the hands finds its wayback to the body, a return that hand technologydefers and inhibits. There is a circuit here that pulses with ferocious energy. It is no doubt one of the reasons for the untimate failure of nicotine patches: although they supply the chemical, they can never replace theactivity of holding and manipulating the cigarette'. The activity of going for a smoke break gives me the ability to escape the reality of the situation I'm in at that moment. So I wanted to create an escape for those who don't get up for a smoke break. I wanted to create a space of temporary fantasy for people to walk around and look at while taking a break. </p></a></div>
