  <div class="info"><a href="https://www.are.na/manasi-vashi/noise-1520545477">IMAGE JOURNAL<p>This is my image journal.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="script/index.html">SCRIPT<p>This is a script. It was meant to be produced as a composition via a set of instructions. Yoko Ono's 'Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings' was a great inpiration for me. I enjoyed the vagueness of her pieces because it allowed me to imagine whatever I wanted from it, and so I wanted to use the idea of vaguness in the script. Our set of instructions comprised of a series of 'do nots', which meant to make people aware of themselves and their actions before the final instruction. </p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="5html/index.html">HTML<p>These are 5 html pages. I decided to just begin coding the first thing that came to my head and wanted to use the simplest HTMl actions. </p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="pixel/index.html">PIXEL PORTRAIT<p>This is my pixel portrait. Attempting to make a self portrait definitely made me appreciate pixel artists a lot more.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="linking_tree/index.html"><h1>LINKING TREE<p>This is my linking tree. It was meant to focus on the relationship between trees and the web, the structure of how web pages link together and proliferate. The idea of one thing branching out into separate parts led me to think about duality and choosing between 'good' and 'evil'. I wanted to send people on a path (of their choosing) but lead them to the unknown. If someone were to go back and try a different path, they would notice that the 'good' and the 'evil' sides were identical, suggesting that things should not be categorized as good or evil.</p></a></h1>
  <div class="info"><a href="boxes/index.html">MALEVICH'S BOXES<p>These are my boxes.<br>‘In the year 1913, trying desperately to free art from the dead weight of the real world, I took refuge in the form of the square.’ — The Non-Objective World, 1927, Kazimir Malevich.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="mix/index.html">MIX<p>This is my mix. I wanted to explore the ways in which code can render imagery, motion, and audio all together. I used a song produced by my brother, Sid Vashi, for the audio, clips of the documentary Blue Planet II for the motion, and ocean inspired imagery with animations. 
</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="clock/index.html">CLOCK<p>This is my clock. I was continuing the theme of 'underwater' from the Mix project. The idea was to portray time as an oppotunity to start over. If I plan to begin doing a task, I tend to begin at the hour or half hour mark. I animated a fish to enter the screen each minute, until there are 59 fish, and at the hour mark a shark comes into the screen and clears out the fish to have it start over again.</p></a></div>
  <div class="info"><a href="still_life/index.html">STILL LIFE<p>This is still life.</p></a></div>

  <div class="info"><a href="filter/index.html">SELECT<p>These are pictures of the human body, filtered as body parts. For most of my projects, I use old images from the NYPL collections. I wanted to make the background pink to contrast the goriness of the illustrations.</p></a></div>
